# Online SAT Solver

This project was created as a Capstone for Brown's Prescriptive Analytics course, taught by Professor Kadioglu and Ugur Cetintemel.
Contributors: Ansel Vahle, Valentin Perez and Sean Segal.

This project offers a free online web service for solving SAT instances. Users can use either the REST API or the web interface to upload
SAT instances (in CNF format) and a solver with attempt to solve the instances.
